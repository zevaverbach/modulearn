- [ ] load data from JSON or an API
- [ ] validate the data: overlaps? gaps?
- [ ] support segments from multiple videos
- [ ] youtube iframes can have a start/end time, for example
- [ ] (depends on above) enable search
- [ ] add checkboxes for 'want to watch'
- [ ] gray out watched modules
- [ ] resolve the 'flashing'/re-rendering of the progress bars
- [ ] related to above: don't re-render the progress bar to "done" or "empty" in current module
  right before switch
- [ ] make it work decently for mobile!
- [ ] either don't allow going before the first module, or fix it so that the first module isn't highlighted when watching the pre-module content (first solution is easier)
